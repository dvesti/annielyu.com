This repository contains the files used to build my personal website. It relies heavily on the R package [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) developed by [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.org/). If you are interested in developing your own website using R blogdown, I have written a blog post ([Fun blogdown in R to design a personal website](https://annielyu.com/2020/01/12/blogdown-website/)) that you may find helpful. :smile:
