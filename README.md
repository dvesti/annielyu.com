# Introduction

This repository contains the files used to build [my personal website](personal website built with blogdown). It relies heavily on the R package [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) developed by [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.org/).

If you are interested in developing your own website using R blogdown, I have written a blog ([Fun blogdown in R to design a personal website](https://annielyu.com/2020/01/12/blogdown-website/)) you may find helpful. :smile:
