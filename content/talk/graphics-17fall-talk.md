abstract = "In this talk, I'll demo a shiny application, which uses publicly available databases on soils (soils map and cropland data layer) to: (1) do intersection between mapunit polygons and CDL raster; (2) get CDL pixel counts for each group of overlaid polygons. I'll give some introduction to the soils data and R packages/functions for manipulating and plotting spatial objects."
