I am a PhD candidate of statistics at Iowa State University. My advisors are [Dr. Heike Hofmann](http://hofmann.public.iastate.edu/) and Dr. Emily Berg. I consulted and contributed to several R [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) web applications in production. Navigate to the [Shiny](#shiny) tab to check them out! I enjoy programming, [traveling](/tags/travel/) and [baking](/tags/foodie/).
