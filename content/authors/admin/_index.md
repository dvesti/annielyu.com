I am a PhD candidate of statistics at Iowa State University. My major professors are [Dr. Heike Hofmann](http://hofmann.public.iastate.edu/) and Dr. Emily Berg. I consulted and contributed to several customer-facing R [Shiny](#shiny) applications. I enjoy [programming](/tags/rstats/), [photographing](#gallery) and [dessert-making](/tags/foodie/).
